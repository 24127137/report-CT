\section{Abstract}
This article list 3 predict models and compare. Dataset we use for train and test model is Fashion MNIST.
\\
The model was evaluated on a 10-class FashionMNIST dataset including categories such as 
T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boot.
\section{Introduction}
In this report, we present and compare three widely used machine learning algorithms for classification tasks: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. Each of these algorithms has its own strengths and weaknesses,
making them suitable for different types of datasets and applications.
